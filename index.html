            <p>A soft mattress might be best for those who are experiencing back pain on a standard mattress
             or those who have pre-existing back problems. A soft mattress is also recommended for lighter individuals 
             as a harder mattress can end up not compressing for them at all. Softer mattresses are generally 
             better for those who sleep on their side, as they better cushion the shoulders and hips. 
             On the side, a softer mattress better aligns the spine, too.</p>

          <p>For those not experiencing troublesome back pain, A firm mattress will generally be more comfortable. 
          When sleeping on a firmer surface, the bones absorb most of the pressure, meaning there is less stress 
          on muscles, veins and arteries. Muscles are less strained, and circulation is improved.</p>
